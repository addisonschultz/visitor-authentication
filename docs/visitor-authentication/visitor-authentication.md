# Visitor authentication

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature is currently accessible to all **Pro and Enterprise** customers. If you are interested in the [Enterprise plan](../../billing-and-admin/plans/#enterprise-plan), please contact [sales@gitbook.com](mailto:sales@gitbook.com) for a quote.

GitBook provides different solutions to handle access management:

- Private content accessible to members only
- SAML SSO
- public content accessible to anyone

With visitor authentication, GitBook lets your server-side code handle who has access to the content.

## How does it work?

## Setup Guide

{% hint style="info" %}
A complete example repository for Node.JS is available on GitHub: [https://github.com/GitbookIO/example-visitor-authentication](https://github.com/GitbookIO/example-visitor-authentication)
{% endhint %}

### Step 1: enable visitor authentication

In your space or collection, open the visibility menu and select **visitor authentication**. (If you're not on an Enterprise plan, you'll be prompted to upgrade.)

Once enabled, you'll have access to a private signing key for this space. Each space has a unique signing key. You should keep this key secret - make sure not to commit it into your source control repository. We recommend referencing it through a production secrets system in your deployed backend.

### Step 2: sign a JWT token and grant access to a visitor

Here's an example of creating a JWT token by signing the access data with the private key using the library [jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken) for Node JS.

```javascript
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");
const gitbookSignKey = "<key copied from GitBook>";
const token = jwt.sign({ data: "foobar" }, gitbookSignKey, { expiresIn: "1h" });
const redirectURL = `https://mycompany.gitbook.io/myspace/?jwt_token=${token}`;
```

Once you've created the key, you need to include it as the value of a query parameter named `jwt_token` the URL of the GitBook content you wish the user to have access to (see `redirectURL`)

Here's a very simple Express application for signing keys and redirecting users:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");
const app = express();
const port = 3000;
const gitbookSignKey = "<key copied from GitBook>";
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  // --> Validate user access here <--
  const token = jwt.sign({ data: "foobar" }, gitbookSignKey, {
    expiresIn: "1h",
  });
  const redirectURL = `https://mycompany.gitbook.io/myspace/?jwt_token=${token}`;
  res.redirect(redirectURL);
});
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

### Step 3: configure a fallback URL

Finally, within **link and domain settings** in the visibility menu, you can configure a fallback URL.

When someone directly accesses your space without the necessary token, GitBook uses the fallback URL to redirect the visitor to a custom URL so that you can authenticate them.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Publish – VA - Link Settings.png>)

When redirecting to the fallback URL, GitBook is passing a `location` query parameter, it can be used to redirect to the original location of the user:

```javascript
// Route handler for the fallback url
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
 // --> Validate user access here <--
  const token = jwt.sign({ data: 'foobar' }, gitbookSignKey, { expiresIn: '1h' });
  const redirectURL = `https://mycompany.gitbook.io/myspace/${req.query.location || ''}?jwt_token=${token}`;
  res.redirect(redirectURL);
```

## Multi-tenant Visitor Authentication

If you're using GitBook as a platform for providing content to your customers, you are probably looking for multi-tenant visitor authentication. Essentially, your authentication server needs to be responsible for handling authentication across multiple different spaces. This is possible in GitBook with a few small tweaks.

### Adding all tenants to your authentication server

Your authentication server will need to know the JWT signing keys and the URLs of all the GitBook spaces you expect it to handle. If you have two spaces in your organization for CustomerA and CustomerB, you can imagine your authentication server storing:

```javascript
const CUSTOMER_A = {
  jwtSigningKey: "aaa-aaa-aaa-aaa",
  url: "https://mycompany.gitbook.io/customer-a",
};
const CUSTOMER_B = {
  jwtSigningKey: "bbb-bbb-bbb-bbb",
  url: "https://mycompany.gitbook.io/customer-b",
};
```

### Giving your authentication server additional context

When GitBook cannot authenticate a user's request, it redirects to the fallback URL. This fallback URL is your authentication server, and GitBook is asking it to authenticate the user and then bring them back to the content.
In order to handle multiple tenants, your authentication server needs to be told an additional piece of information: which space is the user trying to access? We do this by adding extra information to the fallback URL.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-01-11 at 19.58.40.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A fallback URL with additional information</p></figcaption></figure>
Your authentication server can now check the value of this field, and handle it accordingly:
```javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  const customerInfo = req.query.space === 'customer-a' ? CUSTOMER_A : CUSTOMER_B;
  
  const token = jwt.sign({}, customerInfo.jwtSigningKey, { expiresIn: '1h' });
  const redirectURL = `${customerInfo.url}/${req.query.location || ''}?jwt_token=${token}`;
  res.redirect(redirectURL);
});
```
## Custom Domains
Visitor Authentication works well with custom domains. If a space published with has a custom domain like `customera.mycompany.com`, then visitors to `customera.mycompany.com` will be taken through the Visitor Auth flow and eventually redirected back to the space.
